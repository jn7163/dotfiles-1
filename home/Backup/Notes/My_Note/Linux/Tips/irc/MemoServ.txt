====== MemoServ ======
Created Thursday 10 May 2012

MemoServ is one of the network services provided on the Serenity-IRC network.
It allows registered users to send messages to other registered users, regardless of whether they are online or not. It also supports a feature to send a message to the operators for a given channel.
MemoServ can store messages for up to ten days before they are deleted automatically.

You can get help from MemoServ about its commands directly at any time by typing:

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ HELP
    /msg MemoServ HELP command
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ HELP
    /msg MemoServ HELP Send
    /msg MemoServ HELP Set Max

MemoServ Commands

(These commands will only work if you have a Registered nickname and are Identified to it)

    List

    This command will list all the memos you have currently in your Inbox.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ LIST
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ LIST
    Read

    This command will display a memo from your Inbox. Memos are numbered from the List (see above) and you will need that number to retrieve the memo.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ READ number
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ READ 2

    If you get a new memo while you are online, MemoServ will tell you what number the new message is.
    Send

    This command will send a message (memo) to another registered nickname.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SEND nickname MessageText
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SEND Serene This is a memo test.
    CSend

    This command will send a memo to all Channel Operators of a specified channel. You can also specify a level of operator if you want to limit which Operators get the message.
    More information about Channel Operator levels can be found in the ChanServ help guide.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ CSEND #channel message
    /msg MemoServ CSEND #channel level message
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ CSEND #example Hi everyone
    /msg MemoServ CSEND #example 10 Hi senior ops
    Delete

    This command will permanently delete a message from your MemoServ inbox. Memos are numbered and the numbers can be found from the LIST (see above). To delete a memo, you will need the number.
    Bear in mind that when you delete a memo, the numbers assigned to the rest of the LIST will change.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ DELETE number
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ DELETE 3
    Retrieve

    This command will send all current messages in your MemoServ inbox to the email address specified for your nickname.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ RETRIEVE
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ RETRIEVE
    Set Forward

    This command allows you to set another nickname to which all of your memos will be forwarded to. The other nickname specified must be registered and allow incoming memos.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SET FORWARD nickname
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SET FORWARD Santa
    Set Max

    This command allows you to set the maximum number of memos that your MemoServ inbox will hold at one time.
    Once this limit has been reached, extra memos will not be accepted until space has been cleared by deleting memos.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SET MAX number
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SET MAX 12
    Set NoFwd

    This command will prevent other registered users from forwarding their memos to your MemoServ inbox. When this option is set ON, it prevents memos being forwarded; when it is set OFF it allows the forwarding of memos again.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SET NOFWD on
    /msg MemoServ SET NOFWD off
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SET NOFWD on
    /msg MemoServ SET NOFWD off
    Set NoMemo

    This command will prevent other registered users from sending you any memos to your MemoServ inbox. When this option is set ON, it prevents any memos arriving; when it is set OFF it allows memos to be received again.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SET NOMEMO on
    /msg MemoServ SET NOMEMO off
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SET NOMEMO on
    /msg MemoServ SET NOMEMO off
    Set Secure

    This command will ensure that you have to be Identified to your nickname before you can access your MemoServ inbox. It helps prevent others from pretending to be you and reading your messages. When this option is set ON, it only allows you access to your inbox when identified; when it is set OFF it unsecures your inbox again.

    Command:
    /msg MemoServ SET SECURE on
    /msg MemoServ SET SECURE off
    Example:
    /msg MemoServ SET SECURE on
    /msg MemoServ SET SECURE off
