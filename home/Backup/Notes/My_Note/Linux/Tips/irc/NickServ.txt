NickServ

NickServ is one of the network services provided on the Serenity-IRC network.
It allows users to register up to five (5) nicknames. Having a registered nickname allows you to:

    retain the use of that nickname for your own use
    join channels who require users to have registered nicknames
    register your own channel
    send and receive messages using MemoServ

NickServ will also allow you to set options and use commands to protect your nickname from being used by others.
Each time you visit Serenity-IRC, you need to Identify yourself (see below) to get access to all the Services provided by NickServ, ChanServ and MemoServ.

Nicknames must be clean (PG rated as a guideline) and must adhere to the Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP), as this is a family-oriented network. Any violations will be dealt with according to the AUP.

After a period of thirty (30) days of not being Identified to, nicknames will automatically be dropped by NickServ.

If you will be away from the network for longer than thirty days but wish to keep your nickname registration, then an extention of this deadline to 120 days is available. You can ask for your nickname to be placed on 'vacation' in the #Help channel.

You can get help from NickServ about its commands directly at any time by typing:

Command:
/msg NickServ HELP
/msg NickServ HELP command
Example:
/msg NickServ HELP
/msg NickServ HELP ADDOP
/msg NickServ HELP SET FOUNDER
Nickname Registration

To register a nickname, you need to be connected to the Serenity-IRC network using the nickname you wish to register, a valid email address and a password you would like to use for your nickname.

    To change nicknames to the one you wish to register:

    Command:
    /nick newname
    Example:
    /nick sassafras

    To start the registration of your nickname,

    Command:
    /msg NickServ REGISTER emailaddress password
    Example:
    /msg NickServ REGISTER joe@zsfutur.com carrot

    This would register your current nickname to the email address joe@zsfutur.com with a password of carrot.

    NickServ will then send you an Activation Email to the email address you specified in the step above. In the email is an Activation Code which you will need to complete your registration.
    Find the email and get from it your Activation Code and then use the ACTIVATE command.

    Command:
    /msg NickServ ACTIVATE code
    Example:
    /msg NickServ ACTIVATE 1234567

    If the previous steps have gone fine, then you now have a Registered nickname! Just remember one last point.
    Each time you visit Serenity-IRC, you need to Identify to your nickname to tell NickServ that you are the rightful owner of that nickname. Identifying allows you access to all the features of NickServ, ChanServ and MemoServ.
    To Identify yourself, use:

    Command:
    /msg NickServ ID password
    Example:
    /msg NickServ ID carrot

    replacing password with the nickname password you supplied in Step 2.

N.B: You can always check on the current status of your nickname, or anyone else on Serenity-IRC, by using the NickServ INFO command (see below). The Current Access line will allow you to see if you/they are identified.
NickServ Commands

(These commands will only work if you have a Registered nickname and are Identified to it)

    Access

    This command will let you manage and view the access list for your registered nickname. The Access feature allows you to add internet locations you normally use your nickname from, to extend the time you have to Identify yourself within if you have Guard set.
    It is not essential that you use this command, but it is explained for completeness.
    If you connect from an internet location that matches an entry in your Access list, your 'Current Access' will indicate 'Matching Access Mask' rather than 'Not Identified'. This means that, if Guard is set on your nickname, the time limit on Identifying before your nickname is changed will not apply.
    However, even if you are matching one of your Access Masks, you still need to Identify to gain access to all of the services associated with a registered nickname.

    There are four versions of the Access command: ADD, DEL, LIST and nickname.

    ADD allows you to assign another internet connection as being valid for you to contact from. You will need to know your userid and the host details you wish to enter. If you want to know more about your current connection, you can type /WHOIS nickname.
    DEL allows you to remove entries from your Access mask list. Use the LIST command (see below) to find out the numbers for each of the entries you have made.
    LIST allows you to see what entries are in your Access list.
    The nick version will tell you what the current Access level is for any nickname.
        Access Level 0 : Not Registered
        Access Level 1 : Not Identified
        Access Level 2 : Matching Access Mask
        Access Level 3 : Identified

    Command:
    /msg NickServ ACCESS ADD userid@hostmask
    /msg NickServ ACCESS DEL number
    /msg NickServ ACCESS LIST
    /msg NickServ ACCESS nickname
    Example:
    /msg NickServ ACCESS ADD serene@*.serenity-irc.net
    /msg NickServ ACCESS DEL 3
    /msg NickServ ACCESS LIST
    /msg NickServ ACCESS Serene
    AddMask

    /msg NickServ ADDMASK

    Example:
    /msg NickServ SET ADDRESS serene@serenity-irc.net
