ChanServ

ChanServ is one of the network services provided on the Serenity-IRC network.
Channels are the official term for what others might call a Chat Room. ChanServ allows registered users to register up to five (5) channels.
Having a registered channel allows you to:

    retain the use of that channel for your own use
    manage the channel without the need for a bot script
    select other users with registered nicknames to be Channel Operators
    control who is allowed in your channel using permanent bans
    decide what modes you want to use to protect your channel.

ChanServ will retain your channel registration while the channel is in use. "In Use" means that either the Channel Founder or one of your Channel Operators visits the channel and gains Ops status within a thirty (30) day period.
If no Channel Operator visits within a 30 day period, the channel will be dropped from being registered.
The channel will also be dropped from registration if that Channel Founder lets his/her nickname registration lapse too.

Channel names must be clean (PG rated as a guideline) and must adhere to the Acceptable Usage Policy (AUP), as this is a family-oriented network. Any violations will be dealt with according to the AUP.

You can get help from ChanServ about its commands directly at any time by typing:

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ HELP
    /msg ChanServ HELP command
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ HELP
    /msg ChanServ HELP ADDOP
    /msg ChanServ HELP SET FOUNDER

Channel Registration

To register a channel, you need to be connected to the Serenity-IRC network using a registered nickname which you have identified to. If you do not have a registered nickname, please see the NickServ guide.

    Join the channel you wish to Register

    Command:
    /JOIN #channel
    Example:
    /JOIN #help

    You need to ensure that you have Operator Status before proceeding. Check that your nickname in the list of Nicknames for that channel has the @ symbol next to it, indicating that you are a Channel Operator.
    (Note: the IRC client you are using might use a different symbol or way to show who has Channel Operator status, but @ is used by the majority of clients.)
    To register the channel, type the following command:

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ REGISTER #channel
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ REGISTER #help

    You do not need to specify a password when registering a channel on Serenity-IRC, because you have to use a Registered nickname.

N.B: You can always check on the status of a registered channel by using the ChanServ INFO command (see below).
ChanServ Commands

(These commands will only work if you have a Registered nickname and are Identified to it)

    Access

    This command will let you check what level of access a nickname has in any registered channel.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ ACCESS #channel nickname
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ ACCESS #help Serene
    AddAK

    This command is the short version of the AKICK ADD command (see below) for adding a Permanent Kick for a registered channel.

    Command:
    /msg NickServ ADDAK #channel nick!user@host reason
    Example:
    /msg NickServ ADDAK #help Serene!peace@*.Serenity-IRC.Net Stick to guidelines please
    AddOp

    This command is the short version of the CHANOP ADD command (see below) for adding a registered nickname to the list of Operators for a channel.
    For more help on Channel Operator Levels, see LEVELS help below.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ ADDOP #channel nickname level
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ ADDOP #help Serene 5
    AKick

    This command will let you manage the Permanent Kick list for a registered channel. Any user matching an entry on the AKick list will be kicked out of the channel by ChanServ when they try to enter and a banned.
    ChanServ will protect against these entries even if temporary bans have expired (for instance if the channel empties completely) or if Operators remove a temporary ban from within channel.
    This is one point to bear in mind when assigning Levels to Operators, that only certain levels can add or remove AKicks. You may or may not want certain Operators to be able to decide who is Permanently kicked out of or let back into the channel.

    Adding a Permanent Kick (AKick) can require a little "art" when learning how to specify hostmasks. Visit the #help channel for more guidance as to how to set effective AKicks if you have trouble.
    Information to build a Hostmask can be found from using:
    /WHOIS nickname

    There are three versions of the AKICK command:
    ADD, DEL and LIST.
    In the LIST, each entry in the AKick list is given a number. This number can be used to simplify removing entries with DEL.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #channel ADD nick!user@host reason
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #channel DEL nick!user@host
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #channel DEL number
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #channel LIST
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #help ADD Serene!peace@*.serenity-irc.net Stick to guidelines please
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #help DEL Serene!peace@*serenity-irc.net
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #help DEL 2
    /msg ChanServ AKICK #help LIST
    ChanOp

    This command will let you manage the list of Operators for a registered channel.
    When a registered nickname has been added to the list, any time that user joins the channel after Identifying they will be given Operator status by ChanServ.
    If they have joined and identified afterwards, they can use the ChanServ OP command (see below) to gain Ops status.
    For more information about Channel Operator Levels, including which levels of Operators can access this function, see the ChanServ LEVEL command (see below).
    Whilst other nicknames can be listed at FOUNDER level, only one user can be the true FOUNDER at any one time, as listed in the INFO.

    There are three versions of the CHANOP command:
    ADD, DEL and LIST.
    Each entry on the list has a number indicating its place on the list. You can use this number to simplify the DEL command if you wish.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel ADD nickname level
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel DEL nickname
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel DEL listnumber
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help ADD Serene 5
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help DEL Serene
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help DEL 1

    LIST can be used in three ways: plain or by adding -l or -n.
    -l will list any nicknames matching a given Operator level
    -n will list any nicknames matching a given word

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel LIST
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel LIST -l level
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #channel LIST -n word
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help LIST
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help LIST -l 10
    /msg ChanServ CHANOP #help LIST -n Serene

    There are shortened versions of the CHANOP command:
    see ADDOP, DELOP, LISTOP
    DelAK

    This command is the short version of the AKICK DEL command (see above). It removes a permanent akick from a registered channel.
    To remove a specific entry from the list, you can either specify the hostmask that was originally set or use the corresponding number from the LIST command (see AKICK LIST or LISTAK).

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ DELAK #channel nick!user@host
    /msg ChanServ DELAK #channel number
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ DELAK #help Serene!peace@*.Serenity-irc.Net
    /msg ChanServ DELAK #help 3
    DelOp

    This command is the short version of the CHANOP DEL command (see above). It removes a nickname from the list of Channel Operators for a given channel.

    Example:
    /msg ChanServ DROP #help
    Help Levels

    This command will list the Channel Operator levels available to use in a registered channel.
    You can assign certain privilidges to other registered nicknames to help them manage a channel. The various levels and what they're entitled to do are listed below.
    When a channel is registered by a user, they attain the role of Channel Founder by default.
    All users are Level 0 unless specified otherwise.
    As you read through the levels from 3 to 15, remember that higher levels automatically can do everything the lower levels can too.
    Whilst other users can be listed at Level 15, only one person can be the true FOUNDER at any one time, as listed in the Channel Information (INFO)

    Level 3 - VOICE - Auto-Voice
        Can use ChanServ UNBAN ME command (see below)
        Automatically set +v (voiced user) on entering channel with an identified nickname
        Can use ChanServ OP command to get +v (voice status)
        Can use ChanServ DEOP command to remove voice status (-v)
    Level 5 - AOP - Auto Operator
        Automatically set +o (operator user) on entering channel with an identified nickname
        Can use ChanServ OP command to get +o (operator status)

    Level 10 - SOP - SuperOp
        Can use all ChanServ functions for adding users to the Channel Operators list at Levels 3 (Voice) and 5 (AutoOp), like CHANOP.
    Level 13 - COFOUNDER - Co-Founder
        Can use all ChanServ function EXCEPT
            SET FOUNDER
            DROP
    Level 15 - FOUNDER - Channel Founder
        Same as Level 13 apart from the Current Channel Founder, as listed in ChanServ INFO who is the only Operator than can also use:
            SET FOUNDER
            DROP

    Any nicknames that match a Permanent Kick (AKICK) are effectively Level -1.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ HELP LEVELS
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ HELP LEVELS

    This command will display information about a specified registered channel.

    Command:

    Example:
    /msg ChanServ INFO #help
    Invite

    This command will allow you to invite your own nickname into an invite only channel, if you are listed on the Channel Operators list. Channels that are set to invite only can only be joined if the user has received an Invite before they attempt to join.
    In this way, ChanServ issues the Invite because it knows you're entitled to join that channel as you're an Operator.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ INVITE #channel nickname
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ INVITE #help Serene
    ListAK

    This command is the short version of the AKICK LIST command (see above). It will list all the Permanent Kick (AKICK) for a given registered channel provided you have authorisation to view that list by being a Channel Operator.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ LISTAK #channel
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ LISTAK #help
    ListOp

    This command is the short version of the CHANOP LIST command (see above). It lists the Channel Operators for a given registered channel.
    As with the CHANOP LIST command, there are three versions of the command: plain, or with -l or -n.
    Using the -l version, you can search for Operators from the list by Level number
    Using the -n version, you can search for Operators from the list by Nickname.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ LISTOP #channel
    /msg ChanServ LISTOP #channel -l level
    /msg ChanServ LISTOP #channel -n nickname
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ LISTOP #help
    /msg ChanServ LISTOP #help -l 10

    MassKick

    This command will remove all users from a registered channel by kicking them out. It only works for the FOUNDER.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ MASSKICK #channel
    Example:

    MLock

    This command will allow you to lock a set of Modes on to a registered channel. It allows Founders and high level Operators to make sure that certain modes always remain on. Modes can be locked on (+) or off (-).
    If an Operator attempts to change a mode that has been Locked in this way, ChanServ will set it back to the preference indicated.
    A list of modes is provided here for your reference:
    Modes 	Description
    +c 	Rejects all messages that contain colour
    +i 	Sets channel 'invite only'
    +l number 	Only number of people can be in the channel at any one time
    +k password 	Users need the password to join channel
    +m 	Sets channel to be moderated. Only users with a Voice (+v) or Operator status (+o) can talk
    +n 	Channel will accept no messages from outside the channel
    +t 	Only channel operators can change the topic
    +R 	Only registered and identified nicks can join a channel
    +s 	Channel is secret. It will not appear on any channel lists or against your nickname if people do a /WHOIS on you.

    The mode +r is set by ChanServ indicating that it is a registered channel and cannot be changed.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ MLOCK #channel modes
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ MLOCK #help +tnc-is
    ModeClear

    This command will remove all modes currently set in a channel, apart from +r. As ChanServ has removed the modes, it will only enforce modes locked with MLOCK if either an Operator tries to change a channel mode or if everyone leaves and joins again.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ MODECLEAR #channel
    Example:
    /msg ChanServ MODECLEAR #help

    If a user is listed at Level 3, they will be given Voice status (+v);
    If a user is listed at Level 5 or above, they will be given Operator status (+o).
    If you do not specify a nickname, you will perform the command on your own nickname. If you specify a nickname, ChanServ will attempt to Op that nickname.

    Command:
    /msg ChanServ OP #channel
